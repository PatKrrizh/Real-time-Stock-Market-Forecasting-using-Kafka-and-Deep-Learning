# Real-time Stock Market Prediction using Kafka and Deep Learning
<i>“Data is the new science; big data holds the answers”!</i> -Pet Gelsinger!

The stock market is a complex non-linear dynamic system. Nowadays Financial Markets produce data at an astonishing speed from different sources. A competent system is required that can act immediately and produce results on the fly is expected to manage this steadily incoming data with minimal effort.

In this project, as a response to the requirements, I developed a Real-Time Stock Market Data Processing and Prediction application that includes the following features:
-Extraction of financial market data from Alpha Vantage API by making API calls.
-Use of Apache Kafka to stream real-time data between internal components of an application.
-Implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model.
-Performing model training, testing and validation.
-Performing a real-time prediction of future price movement of various equity stocks (whether the value will drive up, down or stand).
